Earn extra income for your site via the Abundatrade affiliate program.  The shortcode puts the calculator on your website that shows visitors how much cash they will get for their used CDs, DVDs, and books.

== Description ==

Abundtrade pays cash for used books, CDs, DVDs, and video games.   Abundtrade affiliates can earn extra cash by referring customers to Abundtrade that send in their used goods for cash.    Now you can tap into this lucrative market by using the Moneypress : Abundtrade Edition plugin.

Install the plugin on your WordPress site and show your site visitors how much cash they can earn for their used goods via the inline trade calculator.  Visitors are given an interactive form where they can enter a UPC or ASIN and it will populate an inline table showing the cash value for the item(s) they enter.

As an affiliate you can set the percentage that you want to earn on the Abundtrade cash value for the trade.  You can use the Abundtrade relationship as a traffic builder and set your earnings percentage at 0% which offers your visitors the highest value for their trade.  Any percentage over 0% up to 25% becomes an income earner for your site.

== Features ==

= Custom Styling =

Users that want to customize the look and feel of the search form, map, and search results can do so
with ease using the new Theme System that is part of the Pro Pack.   Copy an existing CSS file,
change the file name and update the CSS header, upload to the server and you can now activate your
new theme or any of the built-in defaults by selecting it from the auto-generated pulldown menu.

Be sure to send us your custom theme CSS file and we'll include it in the next release!   We'll also list you here in our upcoming credits section!

Users that opt not to purchase the Pro Pack can still customize the look by editing the basic CSS file that ships with the free plugin.
