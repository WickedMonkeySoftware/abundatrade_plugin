Earn extra income for your site via the Abundatrade affiliate program.  The shortcode puts the calculator on your website that shows visitors how much cash they will get for their used CDs, DVDs, and books.

== Description ==

Abundtrade pays cash for used books, CDs, DVDs, and video games.   Abundtrade affiliates can earn extra cash by referring customers to Abundtrade that send in their used goods for cash.    Now you can tap into this lucrative market by using the Abundatrade Plugin!

Install the plugin on your WordPress site and show your site visitors how much cash they can earn for their used goods via the inline trade calculator.  Visitors are given an interactive form where they can enter a UPC or ASIN and it will populate an inline table showing the cash value for the item(s) they enter.

As an affiliate you can set the percentage that you want to earn on the Abundtrade cash value for the trade.  You can use the Abundtrade relationship as a traffic builder and set your earnings percentage at 0% which offers your visitors the highest value for their trade.  Any percentage over 0% up to 25% becomes an income earner for your site.
